This pneumonia detection pipeline utilizes a CNN (default: ResNet) to analyze chest X-ray data, enabling the automated identification of pneumonia cases. 

The pipeline encompasses model training, tracking, and deployment, facilitated by MLFlow for efficient model versioning and Amazon SageMaker for scalable deployment. 

This end-to-end solution empowers healthcare professionals with an accurate and deployable tool for pneumonia diagnosis.
