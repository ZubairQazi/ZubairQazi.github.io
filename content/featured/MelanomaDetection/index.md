A melanoma detection project that leveraged PyTorch to create a robust suite of models. 

This comprehensive solution incorporated an autoencoder for image compression, a range of classification models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for precise classification. 

To address data imbalance, SMOTE was applied, augmenting the dataset with synthetic samples, ensuring our models were well-equipped for accurate detection.
