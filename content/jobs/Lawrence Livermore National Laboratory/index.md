- Participant in the LLNL Data Science Challenge organized by University of California and LLNL. 

- Collaborated with multi-disciplinary team to develop an asteroid classifier from night sky survey images (ZTF).

- Conducted extensive pre-processing of the dataset, including generating new synthetic data samples from the original dataset to address class imbalance and bolster the classifier's performance.

- Trained a CNN classifier with up to 94% testing precision via TensorFlow / Keras.

- Implemented a robust evaluation framework, utilizing metrics such as ROC-AUC and F1-score, to comprehensively assess the asteroid detection model's performance and its applicability in real-world scenarios.

- Collaborated closely with domain experts to refine the CNN model's architecture and enhance its ability to identify asteroids within the night sky images.
