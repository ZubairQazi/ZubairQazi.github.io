- Researched applications of machine learning models and tensor data for GPT detection.
- Engineered an efficient ETL pipeline to process 5,000+ Reddit posts per hour, optimize and transform the data, and seamlessly integrate with GPT detection models.
- Implemented asynchronous Python scripts for Reddit data extraction, achieving a 30% increase in data acquisition efficiency while also incorporating chat GPT data via the OpenAI API.
- Researched applications of tensor decomposition with deep learning models for anomaly detection in graph networks.
- Explored the effectiveness of EgoNets and tensors in solving abstract graph-based anomaly detection problems.
- Developed and implemented an end-to-end anomaly detection pipeline integrating ETL processes and advanced machine learning models, ensuring ease of use and significantly reducing false positives for enhanced detection accuracy.
- Implemented and fine-tuned GAN and AutoEncoder models via PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning with 90% accuracy.
- Applied for and received a fiscal award for $3000 via Google exploreCSR program and $5000 via the DSPath fellowship program to continue research.
