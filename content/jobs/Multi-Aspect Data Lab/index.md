- Researched applications of tensor decomposition with deep learning models for anomaly detection in graph networks.
- Explored the effectiveness of EgoNets and tensors in solving abstract graph-based anomaly detection problems.
- Developed and implemented an end-to-end anomaly detection pipeline integrating ETL processes and advanced machine learning models, ensuring ease of use and significantly reducing false positives for enhanced detection accuracy.
- Implemented and fine-tuned GAN and AutoEncoder models via PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning with 90% accuracy.
- Applied for and received a fiscal award for $3000 via Google exploreCSR program and $5000 via the DSPath fellowship program to continue research.
