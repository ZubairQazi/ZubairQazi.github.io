                  I'm Zubair (pronounced Zoo-bear). I am currently a junior at 
                  University of California, Riverside studying Computer Science. 
                  I tend to focus on mobile application development and data science/analytics, 
                  however I also enjoy dabbling in other concentrations that
                  my friends and professors are willing to teach me about! A perfect 
                  example is this website, which was built with some help from my friends,
                  YouTube, and documentation!
                </p>
              </Col> 
            </Row>

                  I also love Star Wars and LEGO. I have a collection of Star Wars 
                  figures that I have on display at home. I also have a LEGO collection 
                  of assorted sets, mostly ranging from Star Wars to Creator sets.
                  Other than that, in my free time I like to read, play video games with 
                  friends, or work on fun projects! I would like to be able to travel 
                  around the world, but I'll need a job for that first.
